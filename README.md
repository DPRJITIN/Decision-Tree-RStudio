# Decision Tree Model: A Step-by-Step Guide in RStudio

This project involves building and visualising a decision tree model using R and the rpart library. The goal is to classify the Iris dataset, a benchmark dataset in machine learning. The project covers essential steps including data loading and preparation, model training, pruning, evaluation, and visualisation. By following this project, you will gain a thorough understanding of how to implement and interpret decision tree models for classification tasks using R. The evaluation includes accuracy analysis to measure model performance effectively.
